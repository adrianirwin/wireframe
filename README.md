# wireframe
Plugins/add-ons (currently only for Blender) to generate the geometry and UV maps needed to render a low-poly styled mesh asset as a pseudo-wireframe in a real-time context.

## Installation Instructions
Place the `\blender-wireframe` folder in the `Blender\\#.##\scripts\addons` folder. The exact location of the latter folder may vary based on the underlying operating system, but on Windows 10 is `C:\Users\\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\\#.##\scripts\addons`
